# Overview

The purpose of this software project is to develop a Loan Calculator application that calculates the maximum loan amount a user can borrow based on their after-tax income. The application also determines the monthly payment amount for the loan, taking into account the interest rate and loan term. As a software engineer, the goal of this project is to further enhance our learning and proficiency in Java programming, as well as to demonstrate the ability to develop a functional financial tool.

The software allows users to input their after-tax income and desired loan amount. It calculates the maximum loan amount they can borrow based on a predetermined debt-to-income ratio. The program also determines the monthly payment amount by considering the interest rate and loan term. The calculated results are then displayed to the user.
